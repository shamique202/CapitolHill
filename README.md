#   Capitol Hill

##  Introduction:
Many pieces of clothing are invented for a vital purpose before they become fashionable, but as they become representative of a lifestyle or an aesthetic, they must first represent a meaning. Fashion allows us to create and establish ourselves, molding our identity as individuals while imaginably maintaining an artistic expression. Fashion repeatedly sparks the desire to be different enough to stand out but similar enough to belong to the group or culture our clothing helps identify. 

##  Purpose of Capitol Hill: 
A visual platform enabling users to share images with others who see themselves as visual storytellers.
